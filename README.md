It provides you with slider-type options for optimizing and tweaking Windows for SSD. The UI is not modern and fancy, but what it lacks in polish, it makes up for in function. There are a total of ten options and include TRIM support, Driver Optimization, Search Indexing, Event Logging, etc.

Features of SSD Booster .NET:

Compact layout
SSD Booster .NET comes with a vintage-looking UI that displays a list of functions and adjacent on/off sliders. Also, it requires no installation, just run the executable each time you wish to make changes.

To conclude
SSD Booster .NET looks like an interesting optimizer to have around, especially if you are putting your SSD through hoops that a casual user wouldnâ€™t.

Time-saving SSD companion
Thatâ€™s where SSD Booster .NET is useful the most. It practically brings some important drive tweaks, which normally take up time and effort only to locate them. As far as the slider work, thatâ€™s easy. When a feature is activated, the slider will turn green, and red for the opposite state.

In addition, the application comes with a system info tab that reveals your machineâ€™s hardware and OS information. To check your specs, go to About and look for the System Information button.
